        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> A grilled cheese is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
            <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
