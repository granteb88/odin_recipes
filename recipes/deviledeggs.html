    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These aren’t just any deviled eggs; these are <strong>Coen’s World Famous Deviled Eggs</strong>, crafted with the precision of a neurosurgeon and the flair of a stand-up comedian. Each egg is hand-selected by Coen himself (okay, technically by the local grocery store, but Coen thought about it deeply). The yolks? Whipped into a creamy frenzy with secret spices that may or may not include a pinch of magic.</p>
    <p>Legend has it, these deviled eggs once convinced a vegan to “cheat,” a dietician to skip the calorie count, and a grandma to trade her recipe. They’re so good they’ve been banned in four counties for starting food fights over the last piece. Whether you’re throwing a party, wooing a date, or just impressing your cat, Coen’s eggs will steal the show.</p>
    <p>Warning: May cause jealousy, overindulgence, and spontaneous applause. Consume responsibly. Or don’t. Coen doesn’t judge.</p>
